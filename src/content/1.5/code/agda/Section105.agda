{- SECTION 5.1: INITIAL OBJECT ---------------------------------------------------}
{- The *initial object* is the object with exactly one morphism going from it to
any other object in the category. It is unique up to isomorphism (when it exists).
In the category of sets and functions, the initial object is the empty set.
In Agda, we represent the empty set by the empty type ‚ä•.             [snippet01] -}
absurd : ‚ä• ‚Üí a
{- absurd denotes a family of morphism from ‚ä• to any object a in Set.  Agda
already defines this family and denotes it by ‚ä•-elim (read "false elimination").                                                      -}

{- SECTION 5.2: TERMINAL OBJECT --------------------------------------------------}
{- The *terminal object* is the object with exactly one morphism coming to it from
any other object in the category. It is unique up to isomorphism (when it exists).
In the category of sets and functions, the terminal object is the singleton.
In Agda, we represent the singleton by the unit type ‚ä§.              [snippet02] -}

are other morphisms from every set to Bool; e.g.,                    [snippet04] -}

{- SECTION 5.4: ISOMORPHISMS -----------------------------------------------------}
{- Morphism ùëî is the inverse of morphism ùëì if their composition is the identity
morphism. These are actually two equations because there are two ways of composing
two morphisms:                                                       [snippet05] -}

{- SECTION 5.5: PRODUCTS ---------------------------------------------------------}
{- The *product* of two objects a and b is an object a √ó b together with two
morphisms œÄ‚ÇÅ : a √ó b ‚Üí a and œÄ‚ÇÇ : a √ó b ‚Üí b such that for any object c and
morphisms f : c ‚Üí a, g : c ‚Üí b there is a unique morphism h : c ‚Üí a √ó b such that
f ‚â° œÄ‚ÇÅ ‚àò h and g ‚â° œÄ‚ÇÇ ‚àò h.                                                       -}

{- Let's try to define a pattern of objects and morphisms in the category of sets
that will lead us to the construction of a product of two sets, a and b. This
pattern consists of an object c and two morphisms p and q connecting it to
a and b, respectively:                                               [snippet09] -}

{- All Cs that fit this pattern will be considered candidates for the product.
There may be lots of them. For instance, let's pick, as our constituents, two
Haskell types, Int and Bool, and get a sampling of candidates for their product.
Here's one: Int. Can Int be considered a candidate for the product of Int and
Bool? Yes, it can, and here are its projections:                     [snippet10] -}

{- Here's another one: Int √ó Int √ó Bool. It's a tuple of three ele ments, or a
triple. Actually, this is an unfortunate example since it requires that we already
know how to construct products. Let's pretend we don't and just take the following
definition for granted for now.                                                  -}

{- But we want the "best" candidate c---i.e., the c such that for all other
such candidates, say, c', there is a morphism m : c' ‚Üí c such that p' = p ‚àò m
and q' = q ‚àò m. See the figure below.

Another way of looking at these equations is that m factorizes p' and q'. To build
some intuition, let's see that the pair Int √ó Bool with the two canonical
projections, fst and snd is indeed better than the two candidates presented
before. The mapping m for the first candidate is:                    [snippet13] -}

the object that has projection maps p : c ‚Üí a and q : c ‚Üí b and is such that for
every other object c', with projection maps p' : c' ‚Üí a, q' : c' ‚Üí b there exists
a morphism m that factorizes p' and q' as follows: p' = p ‚àò m and q' = q ‚àò m.    -}

{- 5.6 COPRODUCT -----------------------------------------------------------------}
{- Like every construction in category theory, the product has a dual, which is
called the coproduct. When we reverse the arrows in the product pattern, we end up
with an object c equipped with two injections, inl and inr: morphisms from a to c
and from b to c. In Agda, these are often denoted by inj‚ÇÅ and inj‚ÇÇ, but we'll
denote them by i and j as in the text.

Again, we want the "best" candidate c, but the ranking is inverted: object c is
"better" than object c' equipped with the injections i' and j' if there is a
morphism m from c to c' that factorizes the injections:
                                                                     [snippet21]
