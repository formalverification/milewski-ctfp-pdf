{- Chapter 6. Simple Algebraic Data Types ----------------------------------------}
{- We've seen two basic ways of combining types: using a product and a coproduct.
It turns out that a lot of data structures in everyday programming can be built
using just these two mechanisms.  This fact has important practical consequences.
Many properties of data structures are composable.  For instance, if you know how
to compare values of basic types for equality, and you know how to generalize
these comparisons to product and coproduct types, you can automate the derivation
of equality operators for composite types.  In Haskell you can automatically
derive equality, comparison, conversion to and from string, and more, for a large
subset of composite types.

Let's have a closer look at product and sum types as they appear in
programming.                                                                     -}

{- Section 6.1. Product Types ----------------------------------------------------}
{- The canonical implementation of a product of two types in a programming
language is a pair.  In Haskell, a pair is a primitive type constructor; in C++
it's a relatively complex template defined in the Standard Library.              -}

variable a b c : Set

{- Pairs are not strictly commutative: a pair in Int √ó Bool cannot be substituted
for a pair Bool √ó Int, even though they carry the same information.  They are,
however, commutative up to isomorphism---the isomorphism being given by the swap
function (which is its own inverse, hence a so called "involution"):
                                                                     [snippet01] -}
swap : (a √ó b) ‚Üí (b √ó a)
swap (x , y) = y , x

{- You can think of the two pairs as simply using a different format for storing
the same data.  It's just like big endian vs. little endian.  You can combine an
arbitrary number of types into a product by nesting pairs inside pairs, but there
is an easier way: nested pairs are equivalent to tuples.  It's a consequence of
the fact that different ways of nesting pairs are isomorphic.  If you want to
combine three types, a, b, c, in a product, in that order, you can do it in two
ways:

(a √ó b) √ó c                                                          [snippet02]

Or:

a √ó b √ó c                                                            [snippet03]

These types are different---you can't pass one to a function that expects the
other---but their elements are in one-to-one correspondence.  There is a function
that maps one to the other:                                          [snippet04] -}

alpha : (a √ó b) √ó c ‚Üí a √ó b √ó c
alpha ((x , y) , z) = x , y , z

{- and this function is invertible:                                  [snippet05] -}
alpha-inv : a √ó b √ó c ‚Üí (a √ó b) √ó c
alpha-inv (x , y , z) = (x , y) , z

{- so it's an isomorphism.  These are just different ways of repackaging the
same data. -}

{- If we can live with isomorphisms, and don't insist on strict equality, then we
can even show that the unit type, ‚ä§ , is the unit of the product the same way 1 is
the unit of multiplication.  Indeed, the pairing of a value of some type a with a
unit doesn't add any information.  The type

                 a √ó ‚ä§                                               [snippet06]

is isomorphic to a.  Here's the isomorphism:                         [snippet07] -}
rho : a √ó ‚ä§ ‚Üí a
rho (x , tt) = x

{- and its inverse:                                                  [snippet08] -}

rho-inv : a ‚Üí a √ó ‚ä§
rho-inv x = x , tt

{- These observations can be formalized by saying that ùïäùïñùï• (the category of sets)
is a *monoidal category*.  It's a category that's also a monoid, in the sense that
you can multiply objects (here, take their Cartesian product) and there's a
multiplicative identity (here, ‚ä§).  We'll talk more about monoidal categories, and
give the full definition later.

There is a more general way of defining product types in Haskell, especially when
they are combined with sum types.  It uses named constructors with multiple
arguments. A pair, for instance, can be defined alternatively as:                -}
module snippet9 where
  open import Data.Bool using (Bool; false; true; _‚àß_)
{-                                                                   [snippet09] -}
  data Pair (a b : Set) : Set where
    P : a ‚Üí b ‚Üí Pair a b

{- Here, Pair a b is the name of the type parameterized by two other types, a b;
P is the name of the data constructor.  You define a pair *type* by passing two
types to the type constructor Pair.  You construct a pair value by passing two
values of the appropriate types to the data constructor P.  For instance, let's
define a value stmt as a pair of String and Bool:                    [snippet10] -}

  stmt : Pair String Bool
  stmt = P "This statement is" false

{- The first line is the type declaration.  It uses the type constructor Pair,
with String and Bool replacing the a and b in the generic definition of Pair.  The
second line defines the actual value by passing a concrete string and a concrete
Boolean to the data constructor P.  Type constructors are used to construct types;
data constructors, to construct values.

Since the name spaces for type and data constructors are separate in
Haskell, you will often see the same name used for both.  However, in Agda this is
not so and we must use a different name for the data constructor, as in:
                                                                     [snippet11] -}
data Pair (a b : Set) : Set where
  pair : a ‚Üí b ‚Üí Pair a b

{- If you squint hard enough, you may even view the built-in product type as a
variation on this kind of declaration, where the name Pair is replaced with the
binary operator _√ó_ and the constructor pair is replaced with _,_.  In fact you
can use _,_ just like any other named constructor and create pairs using prefix
notation:                                                            [snippet12] -}
module snippet12 where
  open import Data.Bool using (Bool; false)
  stmt : String √ó Bool
  stmt = _,_ "This statement is" false

{- Actually, Agda's built-in product type is not defined as an inductive
  data type, but rather as a special case of the dependent pair type; the latter
  is defined as a record type:
  record type record Œ£ {a b} (A : Set a) (B : A ‚Üí Set b) : Set (a ‚äî b) where
    constructor _,_
    field
      fst : A

{- Similarly, you can use _,_,_ to create triples, and so on.  But instead of
using generic pairs or tuples, you could define specific named product types, as
in:                                                                              -}

  data Stmt : Set where
    stmt : String ‚Üí Bool ‚Üí Stmt
  {- which is just a product of String and Bool, but it's given its own name and
  constructor. The advantage of this style of declaration is that you may define
  many types that have the same content but different meaning and functionality,
  and which cannot be substituted for each other.                                -}

{- Section 6.4. Algebra of Types -------------------------------------------------}
{- We've seen two commutative monoidal structures underlying the type system: We
have the sum types with ‚ä• as the neutral element, and the product types with the
unit type, ‚ä§, as the neutral element.  We'd like to think of them as analogous to
addition and multiplication.  In this analogy, ‚ä• would correspond to zero, and ‚ä§
to one.

Let's see how far we can stretch this analogy.  For instance, does multiplication
by zero give zero?  In other words, is a product type with one component being
‚ä• isomorphic to ‚ä•?  For example, is it possible to create a pair of, say ‚Ñ§ and ‚ä•?

To create a pair you need two values.  Although you can easily come up with an
integer, there is no value of type ‚ä•.  Therefore, for any type a, the type
a √ó ‚ä• is uninhabited and is therefore equivalent to ‚ä•.  In other words, a √ó 0 = 0.

Another thing that links addition and multiplication is the distributive property:

               a √ó (b + c) ‚â° a √ó b + a √ó c

Does it also hold for product and sum types?  Yes, it does---up to isomorphisms,
as usual.  The left-hand side corresponds to the type:               [snippet32] -}

prodToSum (x , Left y)  = Left (x , y)

{- The case_of_ statement is used for pattern matching inside functions.  Each
pattern is followed by an arrow and the expression to be evaluated when the

pattern Left y, substituting "Hi!" for y.  Since the x  has already been matched
to 2, the result of the case_of_ clause, and the whole function, will be
Left (2, "Hi!"), as expected.

Such intertwined monoids are called *semirings*.  These are not full rings because
we can't define subtraction of types.  That's why a semiring is sometimes called a
*rig*---a "ring without an n" (negative).  Barring that, we can get a lot of
mileage from translating statements about, say, natural numbers, which form a rig,
